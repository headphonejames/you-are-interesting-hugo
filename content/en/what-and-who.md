It is primarily about human connection. I will provide a choice of prompts for a conversation. We will see where it leads.

For example: "Tell me what you are proud of right now."

This is an experiment in trying to foster a fleeting but meaningful connection in a space that sometimes feels devoid of it. Ideally, we will create a safe, simple format to briefly engage and learn something about each other.


# Where is this going down?
This is all going down at [KubeCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/). I will setup my booth near the [G-Research Open Source Systems](https://gresearchoss.io/) table in the exhibition hall during random hours of the day.
