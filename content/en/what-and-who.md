I will provide a choice of prompts for a connective conversation, and we will engage in one of your choice.

For example: "Tell me what you are proud of right now."

This is an experiment in trying to foster a fleeting but meaningful connection in a space that often feels devoid of it. The idea is create a safe simple format to briefly engage with a stranger to learn something about them, thus creating a strand of connection. 

# Where is this going down?
This is all going down at [KubeCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/). I will setup my booth near the [G-Research Open Source Systems](https://gresearchoss.io/) table in the exhibition hall during random hours of the day.

# Who am I?

My name is [James Kirsch](https://headphonejames.com/). I'm a professional open source developer at [G-Research Open Source Systems](https://gresearchoss.io/). 

I have [extremely sensitive hearing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperacusis), which is why you always see me wearing headphones. 

I build [software](https://github.com/headphonejames), make [all sorts](https://www.generalfuzz.net) [of music](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTiKBhNy0zXN9g8tk5O15hQ.), participate in many Men's Groups in the Bay Area. 

I recenetly determined my purpose in life is fun and connection. I and am generally up for fun, as long as its not loud fun. {{< icon "guitar" >}}
