This is about human connection. I will provide a choice of prompts for conversation. We will see where it leads. 

Here is an example:

This is an experiment in trying to foster fun little conversations at a tech conference â€“ something small and simple can have a positive and meaningful impact.

# Where is this going down?
The first iteration of this experiment is taking place at [KubeCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/). I will setup my booth near the [G-Research Open Source Software](https://gresearchoss.io/) table in the exhibition hall.

# Why is this happening?

I made this happen because [I work for a company](http://www.gresearchoss.io) that values passion and creativity, and my co-workers encouraged me to execute on my idea. I did this because I really wanted to, and felt highly supported in the process. I work with great people from all over the world who do freaking cool things in open source.

My favorite great ideas are simple. Ones that are fun and make you think, "I could do that." Easy to replicate. I hope that "You are Interesting" is that.

## Please, no tech talk

Having a "no tech talk" rule increases the oportunity for a connection to occur between us. It also tickles me in all the right places.
