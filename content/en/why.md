description: "Why am I doing this"

I made this happen because [I work for a company](http://www.gresearchoss.io) that values passion and creativity, and they said I could go for it. Ultimately, I did this because I really wanted to, and felt highly supported in the process. I work with great people from all over the world who do freaking cool things in open source.

I'm hopeful that even something small and simple can make a big difference to somebody's experience.

Having a "no tech talk" rule increases the oportunity for a connection to occur between us. It also tickles me in all the right places.

My favorite great ideas are simple. One that are fun and make you think, "I could do that." Easy to replicate. My good friend [Jason Haber](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonhaber/), inventor of the [unnecessarily high five](https://www.facebook.com/unnecessarilyhighfive), is an inspiration in this regard.
