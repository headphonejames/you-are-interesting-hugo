I love people. However, I personally have a difficult time at tech conferences. I have a hard time learning in a session format. I feel inadequate by all the vast Technology that feels difficult to parse. Honestly, talking or learning about Kubernetes feels like the opposite of fun and connection. 

I made this experience happen because I work for a company that values passion and creativity, and they said I could go for it. Ultimately, I did this because I really wanted to, and felt supported in the process.

A few months ago, I determined that my purpose in life is fun and connection. This seemed like a great opportunity to explore that. So I came to play.

I also work as professional open source developer, so I want to share all the parts of this.
