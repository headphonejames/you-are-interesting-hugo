description: "The story of this idea"
---
It began as a very simple idea. It seemed like low hanging fruit with great potential. An experiment that might scratch my itch for fun and connection at a tech conference. 

I proceeded to workshop this idea with a lot of people. First and foremost, I collaborated with my wife, who helped give this idea concrete shape. The great ideas from many friends and co-workers added depth and created a ton more work. 

After many additional conversations, it became clear that:
 
 * I needed a logo. 
 * I needed a branded tee shirt.
 * I needed messaging to enroll people.  
 * I needed a website (you are here).
 * I needed a number of great prompts, with room for ideas from other people. 
 * I needed people to staff this idea with me.
 * I needed to collect metrics. To do that, I would need to [build an app](https://github.com/headphonejames/you-are-interesting) to track those metrics. 

Finally, I needed to madly execute on all this in a very breif window of time. This had to come together within a month and a half.
