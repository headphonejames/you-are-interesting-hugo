description: "The story of this idea"

It was a very simple idea first that seemed like low hanging fruit with great potential. It would scratch my itch for fun and connection. 

I proceeded to workshop this idea with a lot of people. First and foremost, I collaborated with my wife, who helped give this idea concrete shape. 

After many additional conversations, it became clear that:
 
 * I needed to collect metrics. I would need to build an ap to track those metrics. 
 * I needed a logo. 
 * I needed a branded tee shirt.
 * I needed messaging.  
 * I needed a number of great prompts, with space for other people ideas. 
 * I needed other people to staff this idea with me, so I needed to enroll people.

Finally, I needed to madly execute on all this in a very breif window of time. This had to come together within a month and a half. I needed to beta test it before KubeCon. Deadlines were very real.
