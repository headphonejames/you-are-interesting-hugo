My name is {{< icon "headphones" >}} [James Kirsch](https://headphonejames.com/). I'm a professional open source developer at [G-Research Open Source Software](https://gresearchoss.io/).

I have [extremely sensitive hearing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperacusis), which is why you always see me wearing headphones.

I build [software](https://github.com/headphonejames), make [all sorts](https://www.generalfuzz.net) [of music](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTiKBhNy0zXN9g8tk5O15hQ.), and participate in several Men's Groups in the Bay Area.

I recently determined my purpose in life is _fun and connection_. I am generally up for fun, as long as it's not loud fun. {{< icon "guitar" >}}
