My name is [James Kirsch](https://headphonejames.com/), and I'm a professional open source developer at [G-Research Open Source Systems](https://gresearchoss.io/). I have [extremely sensitive hearing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperacusis), which is why you always see me wearing headphones. I work on [all sorts of software](https://github.com/headphonejames), make [all sorts](https://www.generalfuzz.net) [of music](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTiKBhNy0zXN9g8tk5O15hQ.), participate in many Men's Groups, and am generally up for fun, as long as its not loud fun.
