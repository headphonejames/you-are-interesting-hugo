My name is [{{< icon "headphones" >}} James](https://headphonejames.com/). I'm a professional open source developer at [G-Research Open Source Software](https://opensource.gresearch.co.uk/).

I have [extremely sensitive hearing](https://headphonejames.com/#headphones), which is why you always see me wearing headphones.

I build [software](https://github.com/headphonejames), make [all kinds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOSHBceY-kg&ab_channel=headphonejames) of [music](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6GmYm47Zgk3tvoCeJbsH5r), and participate in several [Men's Groups](https://headphonejames.com/#mensgroups) in the Bay Area.

I recently determined my purpose in life is _fun and connection_. I am generally up for fun, as long as it's not loud fun. {{< icon "guitar" >}}
